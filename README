This set of scripts is used to generate simple g-code (only using GO and G1 commands, G2 approx. will follow) 
to use with laser-engravers-

Use: 

to only make outlines, use:
python PathImg.py path_to_file, outputName, DPI, threshold, renderScale, offset_x, offset_y, feedrate_max

to engrave areas line by line:
python LazerImg.py path_to_file, outputName, DPI, offset_x, offset_y, feedrate_max, laser_scale

to view g-code:
python gcodeViewer.py  path_to_file pixel_per_mm

processed images and g-codes are saved in /output
